# Linear-Regression

The third project for my Intermediate Applied Data Analysis class from the MscBMI Program at The University of Chicago tested on Linear Regression in R. The code for this repository elaborates on the specific code used to answer questions on Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

Section 1: Simple Linear Regression, along with the code to implement, included some pre-processing of the data and meaningful interpretations of associations between variables. 

Section 2: Multiple Linear Regression, along with the code to implement, included interpretation of intercept and some pertinent variables. A sub-section Multiple Linear Regression focused on independent variable contribution to the overall result, quality of fit (using p-value), and scatterplots with their hypothesis predictions.
